# NASA-Sim-Backend
This an ongoing project as a part of an Udemy course on Node JS, and other backend technologies.<br />
Currently, the repo contains a full-stack web application that allows a user to schedule a rocket launch through a react.js based front end. <br />
As a part of the course, I mainly worked on coding and understanding the backend aspect of this application, using Node.Js and Express.Js. <br />
The backend server can handle GET, POST, and DELETE HTTP requests, and utilizes the Model View Controller (MVC) architecture.<br />
The application was tested via postman
